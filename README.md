	Visualising Uber Ride share Data set in R

Fivethirtyeight.com have release a dataset to Kaggle that they received as a result of a series of freedom of information requests from the New York Taxi Commission (NYTC) called Uber Pickups in New York City. They want us kagglers to investigate the data and one kaggler Rob Harrand came up with a kernal called Uber-Duper animation. During our DBS Analytics meetup yesterday every single pun on uber was used and we looked and used a few of the kernals with some ideas on how we could improve on them.
